# Whackaghost

My favourite project at CodeNation during my 4th week on my first cohort.

During week 4 which was designated 'Project week' where we put the previous weeks of learning into full practice with a series of projects, these projects were: build a key logger, build a dice Game for 1 and 2 players, a Virtual Drumkit and a whack-a-mole game.

These projects were built entirely with Vanilla Javascript, Again wanting to add a personal touch to my projects I switched the theme whack-a-mole into whack-a-ghost, just a halloween flare.

Fantastic project and I'm really happy with the end product.
